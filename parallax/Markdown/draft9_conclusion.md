<font size="+1"> Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is an additional agent of variation layered on top of the natural drivers of oxygen's variability we have highlighted here. </font>

<font size="+1"> Thus, <span style="color:#28527A"> **teasing apart anthropogenic declines in oxygen from natural variation patterns requires sampling consistency and longer ranges of time series data on oxygen that continues into the coming decades.** </span> </font>

<font size="+1"> Climate projection models predict that the impact of anthropogenic warming will increasingly dominate natural variation patterns throughout the twenty-first century. Because of this, <span style="color:#28527A"> **CalCOFI's continued monitoring of the ocean will be essential to understanding and predicting impacts on marine life and fisheries.** </span> </font>

<font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **We hope that this page has helped you learn more about the ocean off the coast of California; how oxygen levels vary naturally due to upwelling, marine ecosystem respiratory demands, climate oscillation events; how climate change affects this variability and exacerbates the risk of hypoxia; and how crucial CalCOFI's monitoring work is in the face of these changing ocean conditions.** </span> Thanks for scrolling along with us! :) </font>

It is important to note that, given how dynamic oxygen levels are in the ocean, aggregation of oxygen data over time, location, and depth inevitably loses a lot of smaller nuance in oxygen's variability. The graphs in this project utilize such aggregated summaries of oxygen data to convey high level trends, so we encourage folks to take a look at <a href="https://calcofi.io" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> CalCOFI's other data products</a> if you are interested in exploring more of oxygen's spatial and temporal variability.

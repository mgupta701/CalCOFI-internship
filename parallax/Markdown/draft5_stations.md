## <span style="color:#8AC4D0"> How does CalCOFI monitor the CCE? </span>

--- 

<font size="+2"> CalCOFI conducts quarterly research cruises off the southern and central California coast to collect a <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">vast range of physical, chemical, and biological data</a>; weather, bird, and marine mammal observation, seawater collection and analysis, biological sample collection using various nets, and more. </font>

<font size="+2"> While some of these measurements are collected continuously over the duration of each cruise, a majority of the data is recorded at <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/station-positions/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">distinct sampling station points</a>.

<font size="+2"> The figure on the left displays CalCOFI's core sampling station grid, located along the Southern California Bight off the most densely populated region of the California coast. This page will focus on data collected at sampling stations located on the continental shelf, as anomalously low oxygen levels in this region affects a vast array of marine life. </font>

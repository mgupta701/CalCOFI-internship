<font size="+2"> California has an undeniably huge economic, cultural, and historical dependence on the ocean, as <span style="color:#28527A"> the oceans provide us with vital gifts such as food, wellbeing, energy, medicine, and more. </span> </font>
  
<font size="+2"> Thus, CalCOFI is committed to comprehensively monitoring the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) to inform sustainable management of our marine resources and support the system's productivity. </font>
  
<font size="+2"> This page will engage with CalCOFI's data on an essential component of the ecosystem, oxygen. We will explore oxygen's natural variability in the CCE and discuss how our changing climate's impacts on dissolved oxygen levels places the vitality of life in the ocean at increasing risk.  </font>

<font size="+2"> Numerous studies of CalCOFI's dissolved oxygen data have demonstrated that oxygen levels have been declining in recent decades, which significantly disrupts the ecological balance of the CCE. ADD: Specific examples? </font>

## <span style="color:#8AC4D0"> How does CalCOFI monitor the CCE? </span>

--- 

<font size="+1"> CalCOFI conducts quarterly research cruises off the southern and central California coast to collect a <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">vast range of physical, chemical, and biological data</a>; weather, bird, and marine mammal observation, seawater collection and analysis, biological sample collection using various nets, and more. </font>

<font size="+1"> While some of these measurements are collected continuously over the duration of each cruise, a majority of the data is recorded at <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/station-positions/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">distinct sampling station points</a>.

<font size="+1"> **Figure X** displays CalCOFIâ€™s core sampling station grid. This core grid spans the waters in and beyond the Southern California Bight, the curved section of the CA coastline from Point Conception to San Diego. The bight creates a large, productive open bay with diverse seafloor habitats and marine life, and is also the most densely populated region of the CA coast. </font>

<font size="+1"> This page will analyze data collected from the core sampling stations on the continental shelf, discuss the natural variation in dissolved oxygen levels, and examine how this variability is made more unpredictable due to the effects of climate warming. </font>

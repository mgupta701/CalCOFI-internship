<font size="+1"> We will engage with CalCOFI's data on an essential component of the ecosystem, <span style="color:#28527A"> **oxygen**.</span> Numerous studies of CalCOFI's dissolved oxygen data have demonstrated that oxygen levels have been declining in recent decades, which significantly disrupts the ecological balance of the CCE. </font>

<font size="+1"> Numerous studies of CalCOFI's oxygen data have demonstrated that oxygen levels have been declining off of the California coast, disrupting the balance of the marine ecosystem. <span style="color:#28527A"> **De-oxygenation can reduce species growth and survival**</span>, causing many mobile animals like sharks to move to shallower waters with more oxygen. In co-occurrence with marine heatwaves and ocean acidification, declining oxygen levels can even trigger coral bleaching. </font>

<font size="+1"> California has an undeniably huge economic, cultural, and historical dependence on the ocean, as <span style="color:#28527A"> **the oceans provide us with vital gifts such as food, wellbeing, energy, medicine, and more.** </span> </font>

## <span style="color:#28527A"> Multi-annual variation in oxygen levels </span>

--- 

[Incomplete, needs work, have to add oxygen time series graph]

<font size="+1"> In addition to the seasonal variation in oxygen levels caused by upwelling, the CCE is affected by systems of natural multi-decadal climate variation patterns such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO, ~2-7 year long cycle), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, ~30 year long cycle), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). </font>

<font size="+1"> Each of these oscillations have positive and negative phases that can affect sea surface temperatures, atmospheric conditions, upwelling strength, and more. For example, positive ENSO oscillations lead to warmer conditions (El Niño events), weaker upwelling, and lower nutrient concentrations, with negative ENSO oscillations (La Niña events) having the opposite conditions. Positive PDO oscillations lead to warmer, less productive conditions, and increased frequency of El Nino events. The co-occurrence of these natural climate oscillations creates strong multi-annual variation in oxygen levels. </font>

<font size="+1"> Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is another agent of variation layered on top of the natural flux of oxygen concentration in the CCE. Thus, teasing apart anthropogenic declines in oxygen from natural variation patterns requires sampling consistency and longer ranges of time series data on oxygen that continues into the coming decades. </font>

<font size="+1"> Climate projection models predict that the impact of anthropogenic warming will increasingly dominate natural variation patterns throughout the twenty-first century. Continuing to track the changing levels of oxygen in the CCE will be essential to understanding and predicting impacts on marine life and fisheries. </font>

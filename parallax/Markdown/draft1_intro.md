<font size="+2"> California has an undeniably huge economic, cultural, and historical dependence on the ocean, as <span style="color:#28527A"> the oceans provide us with vital gifts such as food, wellbeing, energy, medicine, and more. </span> </font>
  
<font size="+2"> As a result of this dependence, state and federal organizations invest a great deal into researching and managing our interactions with marine ecosystems to ensure economic productivity and ecological sustainability. </font>
  
<font size="+2"> This page will engage with observational data from one such organization, CalCOFI, to explore some significant findings of this work, particularly in the content of our changing climate. </font>

<font size="+2"> We will focus in on an essential component of any marine ecosystem, oxygen, describe how it shows up in the dynamic California Current Ecosystem (CCE), and explore how the changing climate's impacts on oceanic oxygen levels may have detrimental effects on marine life in the CCE. </font>

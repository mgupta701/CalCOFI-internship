<font size="+2"> *Noun:* <span style="color:#28527A"> **A natural phenomena whereby seasonal winds in spring and summer shear off surface waters, making room for cooler, deeper waters to rise near the coast.** </span>

> <font size="+1"> Coastal upwelling is the process by which strong winds from the north and northwest blow down the coast of California and, in conjunction with the earth's rotation, push the surface waters offshore. </font>

> <font size="+1"> **Water from deeper in the ocean is then pulled upwards to the surface.** </font>


> <font size="+1"> This is significant because deeper waters are **colder** and **contain more nutrients** due to the collection of decomposing organic sediment. </font>

> <font size="+1"> These nutrients **fuel life in the ecosystem from the bottom up**, supporting the smallest microbes and phytoplankton as well as all sorts of fish and predators, leading to the large populations of marine mammals, seabirds, and abundant fisheries in the region. </font>

<br />

<font size="+1"> This same process that drives much of the productivity off the coast of California also makes the ecosystem uniquely vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of climate change.. CalCOFI's long-term observations of this region are essential to understanding this vulnerability and mitigating the resulting negative impacts on marine life and California communities.  </font>

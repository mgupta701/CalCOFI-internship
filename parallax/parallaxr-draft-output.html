<p><font size="+1"> The people of California receive <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>abundant gifts from the ocean, from food, medicine, energy, wellbeing, and more</strong>. </span> Thus the ocean is an essential part of California&#39;s economy, culture, and history. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> However, the past few decades of climate change have led to the <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>increase of ocean heat waves, ocean acidification, and, a lesser known phenomenon, ocean deoxygenation.</strong> </span> Protecting and sustaining our relationship with the ocean through these changes requires a better understanding of how marine life is affected and how human actions must change in response. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Hence, the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) comprehensively observes and monitors the ocean off the coast of California, and has been doing so for over 70 years. These observations are vital to understand the health of the ocean off of California and thus inform the sustainable management of our precious marine resources. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Numerous studies of CalCOFI&#39;s oxygen data have demonstrated that oxygen levels have been declining off of the California coast, disrupting the balance of the marine ecosystem. <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>De-oxygenation can reduce species growth and survival</strong> </span>, causing many mobile animals like sharks to move to shallower waters with more oxygen.

<h4><span style="color:#28527A"> What is it? </span></h4>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1"> Right off of the coast of California is the region of the ocean known as the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). The CCE is the area of the ocean highlighted in <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 1</strong> </span> stretching  about 1900 miles vertically from <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>southern British Columbia to Baja California.</strong> </span> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> California&#39;s commercial and recreational fishing activity was responsible for nearly $25 billion in economic activity and the creation of 142,000 jobs in 2016, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> A significant characteristic fueling the productivity in this region is that <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>the CCE is one of the four upwelling driven ecosystems</strong> </span> in the world. </font></p>

<p><font size="+2"> <em>Noun:</em> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>A natural phenomena whereby seasonal winds in spring and summer shear off surface waters, making room for cooler, deeper waters to rise near the coast.</strong> </span></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Coastal upwelling is the process by which strong winds from the north and northwest blow down the coast of California and, in conjunction with the earth&#39;s rotation, push the surface waters offshore. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> <strong>Water from deeper in the ocean is then pulled upwards to the surface.</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This is significant because deeper waters are <strong>colder</strong> and <strong>contain more nutrients</strong> due to the collection of decomposing organic sediment. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> These nutrients <strong>fuel life in the ecosystem from the bottom up</strong>, supporting the smallest microbes and phytoplankton as well as all sorts of fish and predators, leading to the large populations of marine mammals, seabirds, and abundant fisheries in the region. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This same process that drives much of the productivity off the coast of California also makes the ecosystem uniquely vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of climate change.

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1"> CalCOFI conducts quarterly research cruises off the southern and central California coast to collect a <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">vast range of physical, chemical, and biological data</a>; weather, bird, and marine mammal observation, seawater collection and analysis, biological sample collection using various nets, and more. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> While some of these measurements are collected continuously over the duration of each cruise, a majority of the data is recorded at <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/station-positions/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> distinct sampling station points</a>.</p>

<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 3</strong> </span> displays the core region where CalCOFI samples, known as CalCOFI&#39;s core sampling station grid. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This core grid spans the waters in and beyond the Southern California Bight, the curved section of the CA coastline from Point Conception south to San Diego. The Bight creates a large, productive open bay with diverse seafloor habitats and marine life, and is also the most densely populated region of the CA coast. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This page will showcase data collected from the core sampling stations located on the continental shelf. Dissolved oxygen levels are monitored at each of these stations by analyzing seawater samples collected at different depths under each location: from the surface down to over 1000 meters deep. </font></p>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1">Oxygen is critical to the health of the ocean and is a fundamental requirement for marine life. Nearly all multicellular marine organisms and many microbes depend on the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the ocean the same way we depend on oxygen in the air.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sources of oxygen in the ocean include the oxygen that diffuses in from the atmosphere at the surface and the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in the upper, sunlight-filled waters. Oxygen from these upper layers is then transported to deeper layers through vertical mixing.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Oxygen is consumed by organisms during respiration, by the decomposition of organic matter, and absorption into oxides and carbon compounds.</font></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><font size="+1">When a region of the ocean is deprived of adequate DO such that the physiological and ecological processes of the marine ecosystem are impaired, the state of low oxygen is called <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>hypoxia</strong> </span> and the region is called a hypoxic zone. </font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Hypoxia occurs when the rate of oxygen consumption in a region exceeds the rate at which oxygen is replenished.</strong> Climate warming disrupts the balance between these two processes and has been worsening de-oxygenation in the CCE.</span> </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 4</strong> </span> displays how various physical processes affect dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean. Climate change affects these processes, as highlighted by the green text, leading to the expansion of hypoxic zones throughout the deeper waters of the CCE. These hypoxic waters are then brought to the surface near the coast via upwelling.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is an additional agent of variation layered on top of the natural drivers of oxygen&#39;s variability we have highlighted here. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Thus, <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>teasing apart anthropogenic declines in oxygen from natural variation patterns requires sampling consistency and longer ranges of time series data on oxygen that continues into the coming decades.</strong> </span> </font></p>

Because of this, <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>CalCOFI&#39;s continued monitoring of the ocean will be essential to understanding and predicting impacts on marine life and fisheries.</strong> </span> </font></p>

<p>It is important to note that, given how dynamic oxygen levels are in the ocean, aggregation of oxygen data over time, location, and depth inevitably loses a lot of smaller nuance in oxygen&#39;s variability. The graphs in this project utilize such aggregated summaries of oxygen data to convey high level trends, so we encourage folks to take a look at <a href="https://calcofi.io" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> CalCOFI&#39;s other data products</a> if you are interested in exploring more of oxygen&#39;s spatial and temporal variability.

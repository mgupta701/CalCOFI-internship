<font size="+1"> California has an undeniably huge economic, cultural, and historical dependence on the ocean, as <span style="color:#28527A"> **the oceans provide us with vital gifts such as food, wellbeing, energy, medicine, and more.** </span> </font>
  
<font size="+1"> Thus, CalCOFI is committed to comprehensively monitoring the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), and has been doing so for over 70 years, to inform the sustainable management of our marine resources and support the system's productivity. </font>
  
<font size="+1"> We will engage with CalCOFI's data on an essential component of the ecosystem, <span style="color:#28527A"> **oxygen**.</span> Numerous studies of CalCOFI's dissolved oxygen data have demonstrated that oxygen levels have been declining in recent decades, which significantly disrupts the ecological balance of the CCE. </font>

<font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **This page will explore oxygen's natural variability in the CCE and discuss how the changing climate detrimentally affects oxygen levels and places the vitality of life throughout the ocean at increasing risk.** </span> </font>

## <span style="color:#8AC4D0"> How is oxygen changing in the CCE? </span>

--- 

<font size="+1">Oxygen is critical to the health of the ocean and is a fundamental requirement for marine life. Nearly all multicellular marine organisms and many microbes depend on the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the ocean the same way we depend on oxygen in the air.</font>

<font size="+1">Sources of oxygen in the ocean include the oxygen that diffuses in from the atmosphere at the surface and the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in the upper, sun-light filled waters. Oxygen from these upper layers is then transported to deeper layers through mixing of the water columns.</font>

<font size="+1">Oxygen is consumed by organisms during respiration, by the decomposition of organic matter, and absorption into oxides and carbon compounds.</font>

<font size="+1">Hypoxia in the ocean is defined as the state of low DO at which the physiological and ecological processes of the marine ecosystem are impaired. When a region of the ocean is deprived of adequate oxygen in this way, that region is called a hypoxic zone.</font>

> <font size="+1">**Hypoxia occurs when the rate of oxygen consumption in a region exceeds the rate at which oxygen is replenished.** Climate warming disrupts the balance between these two processes and has been worsening de-oxygenation in the CCE.</font>

<font size="+1"> **Fig. 4** displays how various physical processes affect dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean. Climate change affects these processes, as highlighted by the green text, leading to the expansion of hypoxic zones throughout the deeper waters of the CCE. These hypoxic waters are then brought to the surface near the coast by upwelling.</font>

## <span style="color:#28527A"> How does oxygen vary across years off the coast of California? </span>

--- 

<font size="+1"> In addition to the seasonal variation in oxygen levels caused by upwelling, the CCE is affected by systems of natural multi-decadal climate variation patterns such as the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/weather-atmosphere/el-nino" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> El Nino Southern Oscillation</a> (ENSO, ~2-7 year long cycle) and the <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/insight/ocean-atmosphere-climate-indices#the-pacific-decadal-oscillation" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> Pacific Decadal Oscillation </a> (PDO, ~30 year long cycle). </font>

<font size="+1"> Each of these oscillations have positive and negative phases that can affect sea surface temperatures, atmospheric conditions, upwelling strength, and more. </font>

<font size="+1"> For example, positive ENSO oscillations lead to <span style="color:#28527A"> **El Niño events with warmer conditions, weaker upwelling, higher oxygen levels, and lower nutrient concentrations.** </span> Negative ENSO oscillations lead to La Niña events with the opposite conditions. The index used to track how the phases of ENSO affect sea surface temperatures in the ocean is called the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI). Positive ONI values indicate El Niño and negative ONI values indicate La Niña. </font>

<font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **Fig. 6** </span> displays a time series graph of the average dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper 300 meters of seawater, aggregated over all the core on-shelf stations sampled in a given year, since 1949. The yellow lines highlight years with strong El Nino events, where the ONI exceeded 1.5. </font>

<font size="+1"> It is evident that, overall, the annual average oxygen level on the continental shelf of the Southern California Bight varies a lot from year to year. We can also see that the **strong El Nino events correspond with local maximums in oxygen levels in the graph**, reflecting how climate events impact dissolved oxygen concentration. </font>

<font size="+1"> Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is an additional agent of variation layered on top of the natural drivers of oxygen's variability in the ocean off of California's coast. Thus, teasing apart anthropogenic declines in oxygen from natural variation patterns requires sampling consistency and longer ranges of time series data on oxygen that continues into the coming decades. </font>

<font size="+1"> **Climate projection models predict that the impact of anthropogenic warming will increasingly dominate natural variation patterns throughout the twenty-first century. <span style="color:#28527A"> CalCOFI's continued monitoring of the ocean will be essential to understanding and predicting impacts on marine life and fisheries.** </span> </font>

## Spring and summer upwelling

A large factor influencing the productivity in this region is that **the CCE is one of the four upwelling driven ecosystems** in the world. 

Coastal upwelling is the process by which strong winds from the north and northwest blow down the coast of California and, in conjunction with the earth's rotation, push the surface waters offshore. 

**Water from deeper in the ocean is then pulled upwards to the surface**^2


This is significant because deeper waters are *colder* and *contain more nutrients* due to the collection of decomposing organic sediment. 

These nutrients **fuel life in the ecosystem from the bottom up**, leading to the large populations of marine mammals, seabirds, and abundant fisheries in the region.

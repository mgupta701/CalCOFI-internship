<h4><span style="color:#28527A"> What is it? </span></h4>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1"> The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) is defined as the region of the ocean highlighted in <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 1</strong> </span> stretching along about 1900 miles vertically from <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>southern British Columbia to Baja California.</strong> </span> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> California&#39;s commercial and recreational fishing activity was responsible for nearly $25 billion in economic activity and the creation of 142,000 jobs in 2016, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> A significant characteristic fueling the productivity in this region is that <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>the CCE is one of the four upwelling driven ecosystems</strong> </span> in the world. </font></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> Coastal upwelling is the process by which strong winds from the north and northwest blow down the coast of California and, in conjunction with the earth&#39;s rotation, push the surface waters offshore. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> <strong>Water from deeper in the ocean is then pulled upwards to the surface.</strong> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This is significant because deeper waters are <strong>colder</strong> and <strong>contain more nutrients</strong> due to the collection of decomposing organic sediment. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> These nutrients <strong>fuel life in the ecosystem from the bottom up</strong>, leading to the large populations of marine mammals, seabirds, and abundant fisheries in the region. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="+1"> This same process that drives much of the CCE&#39;s productivity also makes the ecosystem uniquely vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of climate warming.

<p><font size="+1"> CalCOFI conducts quarterly research cruises off the southern and central California coast to collect a <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;">vast range of physical, chemical, and biological data</a>; weather, bird, and marine mammal observation, seawater collection and analysis, biological sample collection using various nets, and more. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> While some of these measurements are collected continuously over the duration of each cruise, a majority of the data is recorded at <a href="https://calcofi.org/sampling-info/station-positions/" style="color: #28527A; text-decoration: underline;"> distinct sampling station points</a>.</p>

<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 3</strong> </span> displays CalCOFI&#39;s core sampling station grid. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> This core grid spans the waters in and beyond the Southern California Bight, the curved section of the CA coastline from Point Conception to San Diego. The bight creates a large, productive open bay with diverse seafloor habitats and marine life, and is also the most densely populated region of the CA coast. </font></p>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1">Oxygen is critical to the health of the ocean and is a fundamental requirement for marine life. Nearly all multicellular marine organisms and many microbes depend on the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the ocean the same way we depend on oxygen in the air.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sources of oxygen in the ocean include the oxygen that diffuses in from the atmosphere at the surface and the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in the upper, sunlight-filled waters. Oxygen from these upper layers is then transported to deeper layers through vertical mixing.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Oxygen is consumed by organisms during respiration, by the decomposition of organic matter, and absorption into oxides and carbon compounds.</font></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><font size="+1">When a region of the ocean is deprived of adequate DO such that the physiological and ecological processes of the marine ecosystem are impaired, the state of low oxygen is called <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>hypoxia</strong> </span> and the region is called a hypoxic zone. </font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Hypoxia occurs when the rate of oxygen consumption in a region exceeds the rate at which oxygen is replenished.</strong> Climate warming disrupts the balance between these two processes and has been worsening de-oxygenation in the CCE.</span> </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> <strong>Fig. 4</strong> </span> displays how various physical processes affect dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean. Climate change affects these processes, as highlighted by the green text, leading to the expansion of hypoxic zones throughout the deeper waters of the CCE. These hypoxic waters are then brought to the surface near the coast via upwelling.</font></p>

<hr/>

<p><font size="+1">As mentioned earlier, the deeper waters that are upwelled during spring and summer are poor in oxygen but rich in nutrients.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">These nutrients increase ecosystem productivity by fueling phytoplankton algal blooms that support large populations of consumers, with the effects rippling throughout the food web.</font> </p>

<p><font size="+1">During these productive seasons, respiratory demand for oxygen is increased, furthering de-oxygenation. Furthermore, climate change is hypothesized to intensify the upwelling - favorable wind stress, which would increase the risk of hypoxia throughout the CCE.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Analysis of CalCOFIâ€™s data reflects lower oxygen levels during the upwelling seasons.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The heatmap in <span style="color:#28527A"><strong>Fig. 5</strong></span> displays the average dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper 300 meters of seawater, aggregated over all the core on-shelf stations that were sampled at the time, for each quarter since 1949. The yellow stripes correspond to lower levels of DO while the blue stripes indicate higher levels of DO. Gray stripes indicate quarters in which less than 3 core on-shelf stations were sampled. Hover over to see the exact average oxygen concentration and the number of seawater samples that were analyzed for a given quarter.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">It is evident that <span style="color:#28527A"><strong>Spring and Summer have lower oxygen levels on average when compared to Winter and Fall.</strong></span></font></p>

<hr/>

<p>[Incomplete, needs work, have to add oxygen time series graph]</p>

<p><font size="+1"> In addition to the seasonal variation in oxygen levels caused by upwelling, the CCE is affected by systems of natural multi-decadal climate variation patterns such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO, ~2-7 year long cycle), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, ~30 year long cycle), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Each of these oscillations have positive and negative phases that can affect sea surface temperatures, atmospheric conditions, upwelling strength, and more. For example, positive ENSO oscillations lead to warmer conditions (El NiÃ±o events), weaker upwelling, and lower nutrient concentrations, with negative ENSO oscillations (La NiÃ±a events) having the opposite conditions. Positive PDO oscillations lead to warmer, less productive conditions, and increased frequency of El Nino events. The co-occurrence of these natural climate oscillations creates strong multi-annual variation in oxygen levels. </font></p>

<p>[ADD: reference to the dygraph to highlight oxygen trends from Gallo article pg. 6]</p>

<p><font size="+1"> Anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is another agent of variation layered on top of the natural flux of oxygen concentration in the CCE. Thus, teasing apart anthropogenic declines in oxygen from natural variation patterns requires sampling consistency and longer ranges of time series data on oxygen that continues into the coming decades. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"> Climate projection models predict that the impact of anthropogenic warming will increasingly dominate natural variation patterns throughout the twenty-first century. Continuing to track the changing levels of oxygen in the CCE will be essential to understanding and predicting impacts on marine life and fisheries. </font></p>

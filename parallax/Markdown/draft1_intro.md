<font size="+1"> California has an undeniably huge economic, cultural, and historical dependence on the ocean, as <span style="color:#28527A"> **the oceans provide us with vital gifts such as food, wellbeing, energy, medicine, and more.** </span> </font>
  
<font size="+1"> Thus, CalCOFI is committed to comprehensively monitoring the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) to inform sustainable management of our marine resources and support the system's productivity, and has been doing so for over 70 years. </font>
  
<font size="+1"> We will engage with CalCOFI's data on an essential component of the ecosystem, oxygen. Numerous studies of CalCOFI's dissolved oxygen data have demonstrated that oxygen levels have been declining in recent decades, which significantly disrupts the ecological balance of the CCE. </font>

<font size="+1"> <span style="color:#28527A"> **This page will explore oxygen's natural variability in the CCE and discuss how the changing climate detrimentally affects oxygen levels, placing the vitality of life throughout the ocean at increasing risk.** </span> </font>

<br />

<font size="+1"> Scroll along to join us on this exploration of oxygen in the CCE. </font>
